CHANGES
=======

V 0.3.3
-------

- Added generated saved-view management functions in
  `mix selecto.gen.saved_views` context output:
  `list_views/1`, `rename_view/3`, and `delete_view/2`.
- Kept generated behavior compatibility with `SelectoComponents.SavedViews`
  while making richer saved-view UIs easier to build.
- Bump package version to `0.3.3`.
